HW 3 Documentation

The program was coded in typescript.

Code changes
- Imports were altered
- DrawParams interface created and moved to seperate script
- Created consts and added type assertions
- Even more consts created
- Variable type conversions
- Fixed audio.ts
- Add many many stongly typed variables across all files (a few are missing due to not being able to find the right one)
- Defaults enum
- DrawParams external file
- External sprite class created and imported/exported

- Did not figure out what to put in colorstop. file is created and imported but not used.
- burger.js is still js. Could not make work as a .ts
- Did not find code in need of destructuring as there was not large groups of variables being subed in except for color selections.

I'm not really sure how much detail was wanted for this....
