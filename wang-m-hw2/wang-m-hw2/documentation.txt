I. .....I guess there is no I?
II. Audio Effect nodes
    a. Pretty basic...Added the trebble and base node amplifiers when checked. They hurt my ears...
III. Sprite
    a. name: CircleSprites (it is in canvas)
    b. look & visualization: A chaotic sort of bubble blob with multiple radii that has varying fills to match the audio when play is hit
IV. JSON
    a. Contained checkmark data for which checkmarks would be auto selected on load
V. Aesthetics
    a. Changes made
        i. Canvas was centered and rounded for a softer appearance
        ii. Buttons, dropdowns, and backdrops have rounded boarders
        iii. Buttons have a hover affect that color shifts and changes text for visibility
        iii. Accent colors were made to match
        vi. gradient was removed to keep black background
        v. Color of wave bars changes based on height/audio
        vi. circles color shift slightly off of circle radius and are stroke based rather then fill based
    b. grade: 8%? I spent more time adjusting surrounding page format compared to the core audio visualization. Although They changes are not drastic it creates a general cohesive look across the UI.
